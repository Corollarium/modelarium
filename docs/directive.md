# Directives

This is about implementing new directives.

## Laravel

- Create a new directive class in Modelarium/Laravel/Lighthouse/Directives/
- implement its usage in the Modelarium/Laravel/Targets classes
- run `php composer.phar buildGraphql` to regenerate the code.
- applications will need to run `php artisan modelarium:init`
